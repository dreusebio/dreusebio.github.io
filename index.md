    <p>My name is Dr. George Eusebio Kuodza. I am a Family Doctor turned epigenetic/genetic researcher. I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar in the LaSalle Lab and completing my final year in a clinical research program at the University of California, Davis. My research focuses on the epigenetic and genetic mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly autism spectrum disorder (ASD). My work involves applying bioinformatics tools to analyze DNA methylation, structural variants, and other genomic data to uncover molecular mechanisms and their implications for health outcomes.</p>
    
    <p>I am keen on analyzing WGBS DNA methylation datasets using bioinformatics tools that help identify differences in methylation and be able to correlate with other experimental traits. My current projects explore topics like the multigenerational effects of environmental exposures on DNA methylation and genotyping structural variants associated with ASD. In addition to working on ASD datasets, I am currently working on other projects related to epilepsy, breast cancer, and maternal obesity in pregnancy.</p>
    
    <p>Outside of work, I cherish spending time with my wife, Fadzai, and our young son. I enjoy soccer, even though it has led to a torn meniscus, so now I mostly play FIFA online and kick the ball a few times with my son.</p>
